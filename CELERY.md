Here's a clear explanation of the current implementation and what we want to change:

**Current Implementation:**
1. User sends credentials via HTTP POST to get account list
2. Server creates a WebSocket session with UUID
3. Server stores credentials in WebSocket session state
4. Server returns account list + WebSocket URL with session ID
5. Client connects to WebSocket using that session ID
6. All subsequent operations happen through WebSocket

**Problems with Current Implementation:**
1. **Session Management Issues:**
   - Credentials stored in WebSocket session
   - If client disconnects and reconnects to different worker, session is lost
   - No way to recover state across workers

2. **Scalability Problems:**
   - WebSocket sessions tied to specific workers
   - Can't scale horizontally with multiple workers
   - Load balancing becomes problematic

**Proposed New Implementation with Celery:**
1. **Initial Connection:**
   - Client connects to WebSocket directly
   - No need for initial HTTP request
   - No session management needed

2. **Order Retrieval Process:**
   - Client sends credentials through WebSocket
   - Server creates Celery task
   - Task runs on any available Celery worker
   - Progress stored in Redis (Celery result backend)
   - Any worker can check task status

3. **Reconnection Handling:**
   - Client can reconnect to any worker
   - Worker can check task status in Redis
   - Process continues from last known state

4. **Architecture:**
```
Client                     API Worker                   Celery Worker
   |                         |                              |
   |-- WS Connect ---------->|                              |
   |                         |                              |
   |-- Send credentials ----->|                              |
   |                         |-- Create Celery Task ------->|
   |                         |                              |
   |<---- Task ID -----------|                              |
   |                         |                              |
   |<---- Progress Updates ---|                              |
   |                         |                              |
   |                         |<---- Task Status ------------|
   |                         |                              |
   |                         |-- Store Results ------------->|
```

**Key Benefits:**
1. Scalable - works with multiple workers
2. Reliable - process state stored in Redis
3. Simple - no complex session management
4. Real-time - still provides WebSocket updates

Would you like me to help you revert the changes and implement this new approach from scratch?
